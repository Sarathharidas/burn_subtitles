00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I need you so, there's no time, I'll never go 123
    
2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Oh I cannot explain, every time it's the same
    
3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Oh I feel that it's real
    
4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Take my heart, I've been lonely too long
    
5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Oh I can't be so strong, take a chance for a man
    
6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Take my heart, I need you so
    
7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There's no time, I'll never go
    
8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Sherry Sherry Lady, go into a motion
    
9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Love is where you find it, listen to your heart
    
10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Sherry Sherry Lady, living in devotion
    
11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You know it's like the first time, let me take a part
